# Hi, I'm Eldana Ashirova👋

I'm an undergraduate in the **first-ever cohort at the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)** in Abu Dhabi. MBZUAI is a highly selective, AI-focused university, where I study core AI, machine learning, and computer science in a research-driven environment.

I use this GitHub as my portfolio. A place to show what I build, how I think, and how I work with others.
